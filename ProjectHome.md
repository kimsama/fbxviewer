Example of loading and displaying an FBX file.  FBX file is imported and animated independently of FBK SDK.

**v 3.02**
FBX SDK v2015.1 Support added

I added a NULL project that defines the interface required to use the FBXLib and the application is stripped out.  This may prove useful as a starting point to add an FBX importer to your application.

Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Studio 2012

x64 and x86 builds are supported.

VS2010 or VS2012
